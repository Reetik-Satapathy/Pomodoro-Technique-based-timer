A simple timer which is based on the Pomodoro Technique, to help you manage your time efficiently. 
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks.
Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals.
Each work interval is called a pomodoro, which is Italian word for tomato, hence the name.
